# Predict-Future-Sales

For this project we used a baseline model from https://github.com/yijiaceline/Predict-Future-Sales

We wanted to improve both the model accuracy and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

Our code is published on Neural_Model.ipynb

First, we provided a description of each csv file.
We combined all data on the item_id in order to combine quantiatitive and catigorical data together. 

The second step is pre-processing.

Third step, slpitting of data

Fourth and final step, Model training.
